  abstract     = {This book is about conformal prediction and related
                  inferential techniques that build on permutation tests and
                  exchangeability. These techniques are useful in a diverse
                  array of tasks, including hypothesis testing and providing
                  uncertainty quantification guarantees for machine learning
                  systems. Much of the current interest in conformal prediction
                  is due to its ability to integrate into complex machine
                  learning workflows, solving the problem of forming prediction
                  sets without any assumptions on the form of the data
                  generating distribution. Since contemporary machine learning
                  algorithms have generally proven difficult to analyze
                  directly, conformal prediction's main appeal is its ability to
                  provide formal, finite-sample guarantees when paired with such
                  methods. The goal of this book is to teach the reader about
                  the fundamental technical arguments that arise when
                  researching conformal prediction and related questions in
                  distribution-free inference. Many of these proof strategies,
                  especially the more recent ones, are scattered among research
                  papers, making it difficult for researchers to understand
                  where to look, which results are important, and how exactly
                  the proofs work. We hope to bridge this gap by curating what
                  we believe to be some of the most important results in the
                  literature and presenting their proofs in a unified language,
                  with illustrations, and with an eye towards pedagogy.}
